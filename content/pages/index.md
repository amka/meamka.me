### About

I've spent the last few years creating web sites, web services and server applications. But I have always preferred a desktop application than a browser, so I started to learn Cocoa and write the missing himself. So there was the Boat.

This year in my life there have been significant changes and I try to devote all the time to my family, cats and friends, filling the remaining gaps by creating user-friendly applications for macOS and Windows.
